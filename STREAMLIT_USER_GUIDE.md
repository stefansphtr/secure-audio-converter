## 🔒 Security & Limitations

### 🛡️ Comprehensive Security Features

Your security and data protection are our top priorities. Here's how the **Secure Audio Converter** keeps you and your files safe:

#### 🚪 **1. File Upload Protection**

**What it does:** Only allows safe, approved file types
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **File Type Validation:** Only accepts video files (MP4, M4V, MOV, AVI, MKV)
- ✅ **Extension Checking:** Prevents malicious files disguised as videos
- ✅ **Real File Verification:** Doesn't just trust the filename - actually checks the file content
- ❌ **Blocks:** Executable files (.exe), scripts (.bat, .sh), or any suspicious file types

**Why this matters:** Prevents malicious files from being uploaded to the server, protecting both you and other users.

#### 📏 **2. File Size Limits**

**What it does:** Enforces strict size limits on uploads
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **Individual File Limit:** Maximum 500MB per file
- ✅ **Batch Limit:** Maximum 50 files at once
- ✅ **Server Protection:** Prevents server overload and crashes
- ✅ **Fair Usage:** Ensures all users get good performance

**Why this matters:** Large files can overwhelm servers, cause crashes, or be used for denial-of-service attacks.

#### 🛣️ **3. Path Sanitization**

**What it does:** Cleans and validates all file paths and names
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **Directory Traversal Prevention:** Stops hackers from accessing other folders
- ✅ **Safe Filenames:** Removes dangerous characters from file names
- ✅ **Path Validation:** Ensures files go only where they should
- ✅ **No Overwriting:** Automatically renames files to prevent accidental overwrites

**Example of protection:**
```
❌ Dangerous: ../../../system/important_file.txt
✅ Safe: video_file_1.mp3
```

**Why this matters:** Prevents attackers from accessing or modifying files they shouldn't see.

#### 🔐 **4. File Integrity Verification**

**What it does:** Creates a unique "fingerprint" for each uploaded file
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **SHA256 Hashing:** Creates a unique identifier for each file
- ✅ **Corruption Detection:** Ensures your file wasn't damaged during upload
- ✅ **Audit Trail:** Logs the file fingerprint for security tracking
- ✅ **Tampering Prevention:** Detects if files are modified during processing

**In simple terms:** Like taking a photo of your file to prove it wasn't changed.

**Why this matters:** Ensures the file you download is exactly what you intended to convert.

#### ⏰ **5. Process Timeout Protection**

**What it does:** Prevents operations from running forever
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **5-Minute Limit:** Each conversion automatically stops after 5 minutes
- ✅ **Resource Protection:** Prevents runaway processes from consuming server resources
- ✅ **Hang Prevention:** Stops frozen or stuck conversions
- ✅ **Fair Resource Sharing:** Ensures other users aren't blocked by long operations

**What you see:** If a conversion takes too long, you'll get a clear timeout message.

**Why this matters:** Prevents one problematic file from affecting the entire system.

#### 🗂️ **6. Temporary File Handling**

**What it does:** Securely manages all files during processing
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **Temporary Storage Only:** Files are never permanently stored
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup:** All files deleted immediately after processing
- ✅ **Isolated Processing:** Each conversion uses its own secure folder
- ✅ **No File Persistence:** Nothing remains on the server after you download

**Timeline:**
1. Upload → Temporary secure folder
2. Convert → Same secure folder
3. Download → File prepared for you
4. Complete → **Everything deleted automatically**

**Why this matters:** Your files never accumulate on the server, protecting your privacy.

#### 🚨 **7. Input Validation & Sanitization**

**What it does:** Checks everything before processing
**How it protects you:**
- ✅ **Parameter Validation:** All settings are checked for safety

### 📊 **Security in Action - Examples**

#### Example 1: Suspicious Upload Attempt
```
❌ User tries to upload: "virus.exe" renamed to "video.mp4"
✅ System response: "Invalid file type detected - upload blocked"
✅ Result: Malicious file never enters the system
```

#### Example 2: Path Traversal Attack
```
❌ Attacker tries: "../../../etc/passwd" as filename
✅ System response: Path sanitized to "safe_filename.mp3"
✅ Result: No system files can be accessed
```

#### Example 3: Large File Upload
```
❌ User uploads: 2GB video file
✅ System response: "File too large - 500MB maximum"
✅ Result: Server resources protected from overload
```

### Current Limitations

**These limits exist for security and performance:**
- **Maximum file size:** 500MB per file
- **Maximum batch size:** 50 files at once  
- **Processing time:** 5-minute timeout per file
- **Concurrent users:** Performance may vary with server load
- **Internet required:** No offline functionality

### Privacy Notes

**Your Complete Privacy Protection:**
- 🔒 **Your files are NOT stored permanently** on the server
- 🔒 Files are **temporarily processed** and then **automatically deleted**
- 🔒 **No user data collection** beyond conversion logs
- 🔒 **No file content analysis** - we only convert, never examine
